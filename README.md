> Tufts Mountain Club trips visualizer concept

I awoke the morning of August 24, 2013 with a strong desire to make a cool interface for [TMC trips](http://www.tuftsmountainclub.org/trips-2). 

### Desires 

I'm not sure where i'll go with this, but I'm looking for some interesting things: 
* a map?
* a neat visualizer
* photos of trip leaders (from Facebook? : e-mails --> photos?)
* sort-by-type

### Technologies
* node.js?
* d3.js?
* not sure if I'll need a db.
